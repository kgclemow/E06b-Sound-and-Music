# E06b-Sound-and-Music

This exercise required the creation of three sound effects and one short piece of music. I used the application Audacity to record the sound effects of a zipper zipping, a straw stirring in a cup, and the snapping of fingers. These sounds were exported as .wav files then imported into a premade Godot file. Next, I used the MuseScore application to create an 11 note song by placing notes on a scale and exporting as an .ogg file which was then imported into Godot.
